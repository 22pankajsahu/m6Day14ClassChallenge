## How it Works

The stopwatch application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

### HTML (index.html)

The HTML file sets up the structure of the web page and includes the following elements:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- Meta tags, title, and styles -->
</head>
<body>
    <div id="timer">00:00:00</div>
    <div id="buttons">
        <button id="start">Start</button>
        <button id="stop" disabled>Stop</button>
        <button id="reset">Reset</button>
    </div>
    <!-- JavaScript for stopwatch functionality -->
</body>
</html>
```

### CSS (style tag)

The CSS file provides styling to the different elements of the stopwatch application to create an appealing user interface.

### JavaScript (script tag)

The JavaScript file provides the functionality of the stopwatch:

- Starting the timer when the "Start" button is clicked.
- Stopping the timer when the "Stop" button is clicked.
- Resetting the timer to 00:00:00 when the "Reset" button is clicked.
- Displaying the elapsed time in the "00:00:00" format.
